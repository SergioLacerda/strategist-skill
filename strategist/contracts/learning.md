# Strategist — Learning Contract

## 9. Learning Phase (non-blocking)
> **Contracts:** `.strategist/contracts/learning-curator.yaml`, `.strategist/contracts/learning-buffer.yaml`

After mission completes (either `completed` or `plan_only`):

Invoke `response-critic` with the slot outputs and the task-type rubric.

Invoke `learning-curator` with:
- Critic evaluation
- Mission result
- `task_type`

Learning curator MUST present a checkpoint to the user before writing anything.
If the learning phase fails or times out: log the failure, return the mission result unchanged.
The mission result is NEVER blocked or modified by learning phase failure.

**LearningBuffer write procedure:**

After learning-curator completes (or if it fails — still append outcome):

1. Append the mission outcome JSON line to:
   `.strategist/memory/outcomes.tmp`

2. The buffer is flushed at the START of the next mission (§0 Pre-Bootstrap), not here.
   Do not flush at end of mission — this is intentional for crash safety.

**Manual flush (if needed):**
```sh
cat .strategist/memory/outcomes.tmp >> .strategist/memory/outcomes.jsonl
: > .strategist/memory/outcomes.tmp
```

**Rollback:** Delete `.strategist/.compiled/` to revert to YAML-only path. No code change needed.
